        <h2>Ch. 13: Ajax</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Look at js source for JS notes!</i>
        </p>
        <p>Ajax is a technique to communicate to servers asynchronously,
            they also update web pages without reloading.</p>
            <h3>
                Clients and Servers
            </h3>
            <p>
                Client = web browser. This will request a resource, usually a 
                webpage from the server which processes the request and sends back a 
                response to the client.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ajax allows Javascript to request resources from the server on behalf
                of the client. These resources are usually JSON data or fragments of HTML or text
                rather than a whole webpage. 
            </p>
            <p> You need a server to request resources using Ajax. Including PHP, Ruby, Node.js or .NET.
                This is usually from a back-end database. To practice using Ajax, you can either set up a local 
                development server on your own computer, or request the files from an external website that uses cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
            </p>
            <h3>
                Fetch API
            </h3>
            <p>
                A living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method. It has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Response Interface
            </h3>
            <p>
                This deals with the objects that's returned when the promise is fulfilled.
                Each response object has an ok property that checks to see if the response is successful.
                It's based on the HTTP status code, it can be accessed using the status property. It will be 200 if successful, and 201 if created,
                204 when it is successful but no content returned. It will return true if the number is 200-299. 
            </p>
