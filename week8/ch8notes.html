        <h2>Ch. 8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        <h3>Transforms</h3>
        <p>
            The transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. We can 
            manipulate the element's appearance using <strong>transform function</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>Value:</h4>
        <p>
            The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated 
            by spaces) that will be applied in the order they're provided.
        </p>
        <h3>Translation:</h3>
        <p> Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right up or down. These functions are similar
            to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up or down left or right along the x and y axes. 
            When you employ a transition function, you're moving elements without impacting the flow of the document. (Unlike position: relative)
        </p>
        <p>
            Transform: translate(x,y) moves an element from x to y.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
            transform: translate(45px, -45px);
        </p>
        <p>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translateX or translateY function respectively.
            To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include:
        </p>
        <p>transform: translateX(45px;) --to go up you would use Y, transform does not work on inline elements. 
            In order for transform to work you will need to add display: inline-block; in order for transform to work on inline 
            elements.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Scale
        </h3>
        <p>
            the scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors, horizontally then vertically.
            If only one value is provided it will be used for both x and y. 
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
            scale(1) would leave the element the same size. scale(2), would double it's proportions, scale,(0.5) would half them.
        </p>
        <p>With translate you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. which will scale onlythe 
            vertical or horizontal dimensions. Always from the center.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Rotation
        </h3>
        <p>
            The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle balue.
            Rotates from center.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example:
        </p>
        <p>transform: rotate(10deg) translateX(40px) scale(1.5);</p>
        <p>This will rotate 10 degrees clockwise. The transforms are applied in the order they are provided, so the rotate will occur first.</p>
        <h3>Skew</h3>
        <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. If the second parameter is ommitted then the skew will occur only on the x axis.
        </p>
        <h3>Transform Origin</h3>
