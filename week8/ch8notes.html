        <h2>Ch. 8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        <h3>Transforms</h3>
        <p>
            The transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. We can 
            manipulate the element's appearance using <strong>transform function</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>Value:</h4>
        <p>
            The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated 
            by spaces) that will be applied in the order they're provided.
        </p>
        <h3>Translation:</h3>
        <p> Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right up or down. These functions are similar
            to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up or down left or right along the x and y axes. 
            When you employ a transition function, you're moving elements without impacting the flow of the document. (Unlike position: relative)
        </p>
        <p>
            Transform: translate(x,y) moves an element from x to y.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
            transform: translate(45px, -45px);
        </p>
        <p>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translateX or translateY function respectively.
            To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include:
        </p>
        <p>transform: translateX(45px;) --to go up you would use Y, transform does not work on inline elements. 
            In order for transform to work you will need to add display: inline-block; in order for transform to work on inline 
            elements.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Scale
        </h3>
        <p>
            the scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors, horizontally then vertically.
            If only one value is provided it will be used for both x and y. 
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
            scale(1) would leave the element the same size. scale(2), would double it's proportions, scale,(0.5) would half them.
        </p>
        <p>With translate you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. which will scale onlythe 
            vertical or horizontal dimensions. Always from the center.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Rotation
        </h3>
        <p>
            The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle balue.
            Rotates from center.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example:
        </p>
        <p>transform: rotate(10deg) translateX(40px) scale(1.5);</p>
        <p>This will rotate 10 degrees clockwise. The transforms are applied in the order they are provided, so the rotate will occur first.</p>
        <h3>Skew</h3>
        <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. If the second parameter is ommitted then the skew will occur only on the x axis.
        </p>
        <h3>Transform Origin</h3>
        <p>You can use the transform-origin property to change the point of origin on the leement.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>transform-origin: 0 0; More on rotating origin <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/html5-css3-for-the-real-world-2nd-edition/read/8/jzj69abg?fromShare=true">here.</a></p>
        <h3>
            Transitions
        </h3>
        <p>
            CSS transitions and transforms are a lot more smooth than using jsvascript.
            <strong>transitions</strong> allow values of CSS properties to change over time. THis provides
            simple animations. Usually the changes are gradual. It can also be used to add a class.

        </p>
        <ol>Steps to create a transition using only CSS:</ol>
        <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style delcaration.</li>
        <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
        <li>Include the transition function in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration,
        transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.</li>
        <h3>Transition Property</h3>
        <p> This defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned. with all for all properties being the default.</p>
        <p>Using a <strong>pre state</strong> and a <strong>post state</strong> for example, transition from
        rectangular corners to rounded corners, set the original state to border-radius: 0;</p>
        <h3>transition-duration property</h3>
        <p>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take.  You can use seconds(s) or miliseconds(ms). 200ms is the optimal transition time.</p>
        <h3>The transition-timing-function Property</h3>
        <p>This lets you control the pace fo the transition, do you want to start off slow and then speed up? The opposite? You can do that with this property. This uses ease, linear, ease-out, eat-in, ease-in-out. default
            ease is slow start, then it speeds up and ends slowly.
        </p>
        <h3>Shorthand example</h3>
        <p>You can use shorthand and go from this:</p>
        <p>transition-property: transform;<br>
            transition-duration: 0.2s;  <br>
            transition-timing-function: ease-out;<br>
            transition-delay: 50ms;<br>
        </p>
        <p>To this:</p>
        <p>transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;<br>
        }</p>
        <h3>Animations</h3>
        <p>Animations allow you to control each step of an animation vie keyframes. <strong>Keyframes</strong>
        are a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition. 
        With CSS transitions, we're essentially limited to defining a first and last keyframe. It allows us to 
        add any number of keyframes in between, to guide our animation in more complex ways.</p>
