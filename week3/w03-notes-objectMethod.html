        <h2>Object Method This</h2>
        <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
        <p>
            Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
            Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
            Methods can reference the object as this.
            The value of this is defined at run-time.
            When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.
            A function can be copied between objects.
            When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.
            Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.
        </p>
        <h4>
            What is an Object Method?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Objects are created to represent something in the real world: users, orders and so on.<br>
            Example: <br>
            let user = {<br>
            name: "John",<br>
            age: 30<br>
            };<br>
            Then the user can act: Log-in, Log-out, select from cart, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example:<br>
            user = {
            sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"<br>
            alert("Hello");<br>
            }<br>
            };<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes you need certain information for the code to run properly. You can access
            certain information by using <strong>this</strong> keyword.<br>
            Example:<br>
            let user = {<br>
            name: "John",<br>
            age: 30,<br>
            sayHi() {<br>
                // "this" is the "current object"<br>
            alert(this.name);<br>
            }<br>
            };<br>
            user.sayHi(); // John<br>
        </p>
