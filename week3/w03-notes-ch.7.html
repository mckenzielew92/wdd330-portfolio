            <h4>
                Event Listeners
            </h4>
            <p>
                An event listener lets you know when something happens right as it happens. For example, when a user clicks a button, or when they click onto your page.
                Every time the event occurs a callback function is called.<br>
                The following code can be used to attach an event listener to the document that fires when the user clicks anywhere on the page:<br>
                document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);<br>
                It will call the function doSomething() when any part of the page is clicked on. Until that happens, the program will continue to run the rest of the code.
            </p>
            <h4>
                The click Event
            </h4>
            <p>
                The click event occurs when a user clicks with the mouse, presses the Enter key, or taps the screen, making it a very useful all-round event covering many types of interaction.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Using Event Listeners
            </h4>
            <p>
                These were outlined in DOM level 2 and allow multiple functions to be attached independently to different events. They are supported in all modern browsers, although only in Internet Explorer from version 9 onwards.

                The addEventListener() method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being applied. For example, this code will attach an event listener to the documentâ€™s body:<br>
                document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);<br>
            </p>
