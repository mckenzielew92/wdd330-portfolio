        <h2>Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
            <p>
                This chapter covers data structures to store lists of values.
                They include arrays, sets and maps. This chapter also includes Logical
                statements that control the flow of the program, including loops.
            </p>

        <h4>
            Arrays
        </h4>
            <p>
                An array is an ordered list of values. Starts with a pair of square brackets. []<br>
                Example:<br>
                const myArray = [];<br>
                <<. []
            </p>
            <p>
                We can find out the value of an element 0 in myArray using:<br>
                myArray[0]<br>
                This is referring to it's index.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find the length of an array, we can use the length property:<br>
                Example:<br>
                myArray.length;<br>
                << 6<br>
                To find the last element value in an array you will do:<br>
                avengers[avengers.length - 1];<br>
                << 'Black Widow'<br>
                Notice that in order to get the last element you need to add -1 because
                the arrays start with 0. You can make an array longer by doing this:<br>
                myArray.length = 8;<br>
                If your array originally had 3 elements now it has 8, and the added elements will
                be undefined. You can do this same thing to make it smaller and the elements over
                the amount defined will be removed.
            </p>

        <h4>
            Adding Values to an Array
        </h4>
            <p>
                To assign my name to the first element of myArray we can assign it
                to element 0 like so:<br>
                myArray[0] = 'McKenzie';<br>
                As you can see, each element of an array can be re-assigned like a variable using the =. You
                can see what your array looks like by typing it in the console: myArray;
            </p>
        <h4>
            Removing Values from Arrays
        </h4>
            <p>
                You can use the delete operator. And that element will become undefined. The array
                will have the same number of elements, and undefined will take it's place.<br>
                Example:<br>
                delete McKenzie[0];
            </p>
        <h4>
            Destructuring Arrays
        </h4>
            <p>
                You can learn about destructuring arrays, or changing the values of the elements or
                changing the order by reading about it <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/3/k01nwtdb?fromShare=true">here.</a>
            </p>
        <h4>
            Pop, Push Shift and Unshift
        </h4>    
            <p>
                To remove the last item of an array you use the pop() method.<br>
                Example:<br>
                avengers.pop();
            </p>
            <p>
                Shift removed the first element of an array:<br>
                Example:<br>
                avengers.shift();
            </p>
            <p>
                Push method appends a new value to the end of an array:<br>
                avengers.push('Thor');
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you can use the unshift() to add an element at the beginning of the array.
            </p>
        <h4>
            Merging Arrays
        </h4>
            <p>
                concat() method is used to merge an array with one of more arrays:<br>
                avengers.concat(['Hulk','Hawkeye',Black Widow]);<br>
                This will add these three elements to the end of the array you already have named
                avengers.
            </p>
        <h4>
            The join() Method
        </h4>
            <p>
                Learn about join <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/3/k01nwtel?fromShare=true">here.</a>
            </p>
        <h4>Slicing and Splicing</h4> 
            <p>
                slice() will take a number of elements defined within the array. <br>
                Example:<br>
                avengers.slice(2,4) <br>
                This will grab the elements starting at the third item and finishes at the 4th 
                (The item with index 4 isn't included.)
            </p>
            <p> splice() removes item from an array and inserts new ones in their place<br>
                Example:<br>
                avengers.splice(3, 1, 'Scarlet Witch');<br>
                << ['Hulk']<br>
                The first number in the parentheses tells us the index at which to start the splice. In the example we started at index 3, 
                which is the fourth item in the array ('Hulk'). The second number tells us how many items to remove from the array. You can also 
                do this without removing any items in the array by indicating 0 removed. Be careful with splice() as the changes are permanent.
            </p>
        <h4>Reverse</h4>
            <p>
                We can reverse the items in an array by using the reverse() method.<br>
                Example: avengers.reverse();
            </p>
        <h4>Sort</h4>
            <p>
                sort() will sort the items of the array in alphabetical order. If you have integers in your array, they will 
                be sorted alphabetically as well. Taking them out of sequence numerically.
            </p>
        <h4>
            Sets
        </h4>
            <p>
                You want to use a set when you don't want any of the elements to be duplicated. To create a set, do:
                Example:<br>
                const list = new Set();
            </p>
        <h4>
            Adding Values to Sets
        </h4>
            <p>
                Values can be placed into a set using the add method:<br>
                Example:<br>
                list.add(1).add(2).add(3).add(4);<br>
                << Set {1,2,3,4}<br>
                If you try to add a value to the set that already exist, it will be ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can also be done like so:<br>
                const numbers = new Set([1,2,3]);<br>
                All non-primitive values, such as arrays and objects, are considered unique values, even if they 
                contain the same values. On the face of it, this appears to allow duplicate values appear in a set:<br>
                Example:<br>
                const arrays = new Set().add([1]).add([1]);<br>
                arrays<br>
                << Set { [ 1 ], [ 1 ] }
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find the numbers of values in a set by using the size() method.
            </p>
            <p>
                has() method can be checked to see if a value is in a set.<br>
                Example:<br>
                avengers.has('Superman');
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the delete() method will remove a value from the set. It will return a boolean 
                true or false. True will mean it's removed. False will indicate it was not there in the first place
                and cannot be removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                clear() method will remove all values from the set.
            </p>
        <h4>
            Converting Sets to Arrays
        </h4>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/3/k01nwth8?fromShare=true">Learn about them here.</a>
                
It's also possible to use the Array.from() method to convert a set into an array. The following code would achieve the same result as using the spread operator above:<br>
                Example:<br>
                const shoppingSet = new Set().add('Apples').add('Bananas').add('Beans');<br>
                const shoppingArray = Array.from(shoppingSet);<br>
                By combining this use of the spread operator with the ability to pass an array to the new Set() constructor, we now have a convenient way to create a copy of an array with any duplicate values removed:<br>
                Example:<br>
                const duplicate = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6 ,5,3,5,9];<br>
                << [ 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 9 ]<br>
                const nonDuplicate = [...new Set(repeatedArray)];<br>
                << [ 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 2, 6 ]<br>
            </p>
