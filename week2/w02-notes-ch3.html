        <h2>Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
            <p>
                This chapter covers data structures to store lists of values.
                They include arrays, sets and maps. This chapter also includes Logical
                statements that control the flow of the program, including loops.
            </p>

        <h4>
            Arrays
        </h4>
            <p>
                An array is an ordered list of values. Starts with a pair of square brackets. []<br>
                Example:<br>
                const myArray = [];<br>
                <<. []
            </p>
            <p>
                We can find out the value of an element 0 in myArray using:<br>
                myArray[0]<br>
                This is referring to it's index.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find the length of an array, we can use the length property:<br>
                Example:<br>
                myArray.length;<br>
                << 6<br>
                To find the last element value in an array you will do:<br>
                avengers[avengers.length - 1];<br>
<< 'Black Widow'<br>
                Notice that in order to get the last element you need to add -1 because
                the arrays start with 0. You can make an array longer by doing this:<br>
                myArray.length = 8;<br>
                If your array originally had 3 elements now it has 8, and the added elements will
                be undefined. You can do this same thing to make it smaller and the elements over
                the amount defined will be removed.
            </p>

        <h4>
            Adding Values to an Array
        </h4>
            <p>
                To assign my name to the first element of myArray we can assign it
                to element 0 like so:<br>
                myArray[0] = 'McKenzie';<br>
                As you can see, each element of an array can be re-assigned like a variable using the =. You
                can see what your array looks like by typing it in the console: myArray;
            </p>
        <h4>
            Removing Values from Arrays
        </h4>
            <p>
                You can use the delete operator. And that element will become undefined. The array
                will have the same number of elements, and undefined will take it's place.<br>
                Example:<br>
                delete McKenzie[0];
            </p>
        <h4>
            Destructuring Arrays
        </h4>
            <p>
                You can learn about destructuring arrays, or changing the values of the elements or
                changing the order by reading about it <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/3/k01nwtdb?fromShare=true">here.</a>
            </p>
        <h4>
            Pop, Push Shift and Unshift
        </h4>    
            <p>
                To remove the last item of an array you use the pop() method.<br>
                Example:<br>
                avengers.pop();
            </p>
            <p>
                Shift removed the first element of an array:<br>
                Example:<br>
                avengers.shift();
            </p>
            <p>
                Push method appends a new value to the end of an array:<br>
                avengers.push('Thor');
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you can use the unshift() to add an element at the beginning of the array.
            </p>
