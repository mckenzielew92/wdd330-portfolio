            <h4>Commenting Code</h4>
                <p>
                    Commenting code is important! If will be helpful when you come back to your assignment in a few days or 
                    even a few years later. It will explain what each snippet of code does and it's purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To write a comment simply enter // to comment one line of code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multi-line comment starts with a /* and ends in a */.
                </p>
            <h4>Syntax/Grammar</h4>
                <p>
                    Javascript syntax is known as C-style syntax because of its similarities with theC programming language.
                    It’s considered best practice to combine the two and write each statement on a new line, terminated by a semi-colon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:<br>
                    const message = 'Hello World!';<br> 
                    alert(message);
                </p>
                <p>
                    A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:<br>
                    {
                        // this is a block containing 2 statements<br>
                            const message = 'Hello!';<br>
                            alert(message);
                        }
                </p>
            <h4> Primitive Data Types </h4>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the types listed below:
                </p>  
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)</li>
                <li>Number</li>   
                <li>Boolean</li>   
                <li>Undefined</li>    
                <li>Null</li>    
                  <p>
                    Any value that isn’t one of the primitive data types listed above is an <strong>object</strong>. These include arrays, functions and object literals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Example:<br>
                      typeof 'hello'<br>
                    << 'string'<br>
                    typeof 10<br>
                    << 'number'<br>
                    typeof true<br>
                    << 'boolean'<br>
                    typeof { ninja: 'turtle' }<br>
                    << 'object'<br>
                    typeof [ 1, 2, 3 ]<br>
                    << 'object' (All non-primitive data types return a type of 'object'.)<br>
                  </p>
            <h4> Declaring and Assigning Variables</h4>
                <p>
                    Make sure that your names for the variables describe what the variable is. Constant and variable names can start with any upper or 
                    lower-case letter, an underscore, _ , or dollar character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them. Remember to BE CONSISTENT.<br>
                    <strong>const</strong> = a variable that is always constant and wont be changed.<br>
                    <strong>let</strong> = a variable that may be reassigned later. (This is used instead of var now)
                </p>
                <p>Example:<br>
                    let score = 0; // This value may change during the programming
                </p>
                <p>
                    To see the value of a variable, simply enter it in the console and press enter <br>
                    name
                    << 'Alexa'
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can even declare and assign multiple variables at the same time if you separate them with commas:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: <br>let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>You should try to use <u>const</u> to declare most variables.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are declared in.
                </p>
                <p>If you assign a non-primitive value to a variable, then this is done by reference, so any changes that are subsequently made will affect all references to that object:
                    <br>
                    const c = { value: 1 };<br>
                    let d = c; // c.value = 1, d.value = 1<br>
                    d.value = 2; // c.value = 2, d.value = 2<br>
                    In the example above, the change to the value property of d also results in the value property of c changing as well. This is because the variables c and d are both 
                    referencing the same object, so any changes to one of them will also affect the other.
                </p>
            <h4>
                Global Scope
            </h4>
                <p>
                    Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope. It is not considered good practice
                    <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/2/k01nwt1b?fromShare=true">Learn more here. </a>
                    In ES6, blocks can be used to create a local scope. This means that any variables defined inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside 
                    that block and not be accessible outside of that block.
                </p>

                Using a Constructor Function
            </h4>
                <p>
                    If you want to use double quote marks inside a string literal, you need to use single quote marks to enclose the string. And if you want to use an 
                    apostrophe in your string, you will need to use double quote marks to enclose the string, otherwise the apostrophe will terminate the string, causing an error:

                Backslashes
            </h4>
                <p>
                    Backslashes are used to escape special characters such as:<br>
                    <li>
                        Single quote marks: \''
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Double quote marks: \""
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        End of line quote marks: \n
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Carriage return: \r
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tab: \t
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Backslash: \\
                    </li>
                </p>

                NaN
            </h4>
                <p> Stands for Not a number.

            <h4>
                Strings
            </h4>
                <p>
                    When using strings use the back-ticks instead of any kind of quotation marks. 
                    This will make it so you can use ' as well as " in your strings.
                </p>

                Incrementing Values
            </h4>
                <p>
                    May use ++ or -- to increment by one either way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:<br>
                    points++; // will return 6, then increase points to 7
                    << 6<br>
                    ++points; // will increase points to 8, then return it
                    << 8
                </p>
            <h4>
                Converting Strings to Numbers
            </h4>
                <p>
                    The best way to change a string to a number is to use the Number method. This will convert the string form of a number into an actual number:<br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Number('23');<br>
                    << 23
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also multiply a numerical string by 1 , which will coerce it into a number:<br>
                    const answer = '5' * 1;<br>
                    << 5<br>
                    typeof answer;<br>
                    << "number"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another trick is to simply place a + operator in front of it:<br>
                    Example:<br>
                    const answer = +'5';<br>
                    << 5<br>
                    typeof answer;<br>
                    << 'number'
                </p>
