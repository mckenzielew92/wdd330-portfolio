        <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>
            What is object oriented programming? Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than functions.  
            It is not a programming language or tool. An object is a portion of code that contains functions that are related in some way. Watch a video explaining this method of programming 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Object oriented programming is a big deal to recruiting companies. It's something work learning and showing on a resume.
        </p>
        <h4>4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In Object Oriented Programming the functions are referred to as methods, and the variables are referred to as properties. <br>
        </p>
        <h4>
            Encapsulation
        </h4>
        <p>
            Encapsulation is when we group related properties and methods that operate on them into objects.
            Example: <emphasis>Check JS in console</emphasis> to find the different in the object oriented way vs. the way that isn't.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Abstraction
        </h4>
        <p>
            We can hide some of the methods and properties from the outside. It creates a simpler interface of an object.
            It also helps reduce the impact of change. None of the changes will leak to the outside of the object. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Inheritance
        </h4>
        <p>
            Eliminates redundant code. HTML elements like CheckBox, TextBox, and Select all have properties like hidden and innerHTML and methods like click() and focus() instead of redefining all of the HTML functions
            we can define these into one HTML object called HTMLElement and have other objects inherit these properties and methods.<br>
            hidden<br>
            innerHTML<br>
            click()<br>
            focus()<br>
        </p>
        <h4>
            Polymorphism
        </h4>
        <p>
            Means many forms. Allows you to get rid of long if and else or switch and case statements. If we want to render multiple HTMLElements our code would look like this: <emphasis>Look at console</emphasis>
        </p>

            //Object Oriented Programming Example:
            console.log('Hello World!');

            //create object, curly braces are object literal
            const circle = {
                radius: 1,
                location: {
                    x:1,
                    y:1
                },
                draw: function(){
                    console.log('draw');
                }
            };
            // This circle object has 3 members, radius, location and draw(). members and radius are properties,
            //draw is the method.

            circle.draw();

            //factory or constructor function:

            function createCircle(radius) {
                return{
                    radius,
                    draw: function() {
                        console.log('draw');
                    }
                };
            }
            const circle2 = createCircle(1);
            
            //constructor function starts with a capital letter!
            function Circle(radius) {
                this.radius = radius;
                this.draw = function(){
                    console.log('draw');
                }
            }
            const another = new Circle(1);

            //let x = new object
            let x = {}
            new String(); //'', "", ``
